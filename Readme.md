# A to Z of Rust
This is a collection of resources for learning the Rust programming language. 
#### For windows users you need VC++ linker, please install rust from official website.
### Datatypes in Rust
Two major data types of rust are scaler types and compund types
1. Scaler types - such as interger float etc.    
2. Compond types - such as premitive - arrays and tuples and complex - Strings, vectors etc. 

### Functions in Rust
Functions are used to perform specific task. They can be called anywhere in program.
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```
In above example we have defined function named `main` which prints "Hello World!" on console.

### Variables in Rust
Variables are containers that store values. In rust variables are immutable by default but they can also be mutable.
let x = 5; //immutable variable
println!("{}",x);
let mut y = 10; //mutable variable
y += 1;
println!("{}",y);
In above example first line
